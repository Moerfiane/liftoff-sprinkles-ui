Title
Boiled Egg 

Description
Think boiling an egg is easy? You’d be surprised how many introductory cooks struggle with this basic cooking task. Let’s take it step-by-step in this module. 
 
Tools
* Pot: For boiling water 
* Timer 
* Slotted spoon or tongs 
* Bowl with ice water 
  
Ingredients
* Eggs (depending on how many you are wanting to cook) 
* Water 
* Salt(optional) 

Notes
* Soft-boiled egg with runny yolk - cook for 4-5 minutes (solid whites, yolk is still runny) (great for dipping toast in) 
* Medium-boiled egg with partial set yolk - cook for 6-7 minutes (solid white, yolk is mostly set but still slightly runny in the middle) 
* Hard-boiled eggs- cook for 9-12 minutes (white and yolk are completely cooked, yolk will be firm and pale yellow, overcooking may cause greenish ring around the yolk but still safe to eat) (perfect for deviled eggs) 

Steps
1) Place the eggs in a single layer at the bottom of a pot. 
2) Fill the pot with enough water to cover the eggs by about an inch. 
3) Bring the water to a boil over medium-high heat. 
4) Once the water boils, reduce the heat to low (or turn it off for gas stoves) to maintain a gentle simmer. 
5) Start timing the eggs based on your desired level of doneness. 
6) When the cooking time is up, remove the eggs with a slotted spoon or tongs and place them in a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. This step is especially important for soft and medium-boiled eggs to prevent further cooking.

Steps
Prepare the sandwich: 
* Spread butter evenly on one side of each bread slice. The butter should be at room temperature to make spreading easier.

Cook the sandwich:

* Once the pan is warm, place the sandwich in the pan, buttered side down.

* Carefully flip the sandwich with the spatula and cook the other side for another 2-4 minutes until it’s also golden brown and the cheese is melted. 
 
Serve:
